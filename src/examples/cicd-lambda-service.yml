  This example shows how a node application being deployed to Lambda
  can setup a CICD pipeline with this orb.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    cyber4all: cyber4all/orb@1.0.3

  workflows:
    integration-testing:
      jobs:
        - cyber4all/lint-app:
            docker-image: cimg/node:18.0.0
            isNode: true

        - cyber4all/test-app:
            docker-image: cimg/node:18.0.0
            isNode: true

        - cyber4all/deploy-lambda:
            deploy: false # explicitly shows in develeopment (won't login i.e doesn't need context)
            filters:
              branches:
                ignore: releases

    deploy-production:
      jobs:
        - cyber4all/deploy-lambda:
            deploy: true
            tag: $(cat ./package.json | grep version | head -1 | awk -F= "{ print $2 }" | sed 's/[version:,\",]//g' | tr -d '[[:space:]]')
            function-name: "$FUNCTION_NAME"
            filters:
              branches:
                only: releases
